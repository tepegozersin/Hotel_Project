### ðŸ§¹ Exploratory Data Analysis

This Python script (`exploratory_analysis.py`) performs initial data inspection and cleaning on all four datasets:

- Checks for null values and duplicates
- Reviews column data types and formatting
- Applies basic cleaning like removing rows with missing departments or fixing date formats

This step was crucial before loading the data into PostgreSQL and using Tableau for visualization.
